ServiceCloud No: 20010758 Rally No: DE421898
If one or more results from a view phase contain attribute with round brackets in it, then during the next phase, the DSA  assumes the round bracket which is actually part of the attribute value as the end of the filter, and results in generating incorrect filter.

ServiceCloud No: 01270203 Rally No: DE399897/DE405407
From the trace log, one cannot distinguish a replication message, whether the message is coming from the MW or MW-DISP Process.

ServiceCloud No: 01270203 Rally No: DE399897/DE405409

In Build No. 15741 (14.1.00 GA)
-------------------------------

ServiceCloud No: 01195819 Rally No: DE386728
In the Management UI, if the "use-roles" or "use dynamic roles" setting is set to "true," and the user tries to re-initialize the dsa, the dsa stops and a warning log is reported.

ServiceCloud No: 01186106 Rally No: DE384685
Fixed an issue where SCIM Server Trace Log and Timeout Issue is observed due to the same connection handle getting used for all incoming API Requests.

In Build No. 14812 ( GA)
-------------------------------

ServiceCloud No: 00953315 Rally No: DE343765
Fixed an issue where management ui is not able to create DSA when large number of knowledge DSAs are added.

ServiceCloud No: 00956667 Rally No: DE344441
Fixed an issue where management ui is not able to create host when a DSA in the host has large list of DSAs in precedence and write-precedence settings.

ServiceCloud No: 00935034 Rally No: DE340014
Fixed an issue where setting "precedence" for subordinate DSAs caused peer DSAs precedence to be reversed.

Rally No: DE328635

Addressed an issue for handling the dxMemberURL attribute in dynamic groups, where the default filter ("(objectClass=*)") is added if it is not provided.

Rally No: DE275934
Fixed an assertion failure that could occur intermittently during pull replication request when the connection is dropped at the same time.

Rally No: DE311966
A MW-DISP issue has been resolved when the minimum authentication level was configured as clear-password and the auth-levels included anonymous (i.e. auth-levels = anonymous, clear-password). During this configuration the DSAs would never successful synchronize with a "WARN : Bind: Credentials not supplied" error. While auth-levels should not include anonymous, this DSA now tolerates this in the case where this is set unintentionally.

Rally No: DE323740
Editing raw settings of a DSA no longer prevents the user from moving forward in Internet Explorer.

ServiceCloud No: 00858152 Rally No: DE324891
Avoid automatic retry against another peer DSA when pull replication search request fails. There can only be one pull replication source.

Rally No: DE295156
A warning is now logged if a multi-write DSA is configured with "min-auth" that is higher than the lowest "auth-level"

ServiceCloud No: 00879936 Rally No: DE326858
A server side sorting memory leak has been resolved where a sort search is in the scope of multiple DSAs. The memory is cleared when the connection is cleared, however, if the connection is continuously busy the DSA can consume a large amount of memory over time.

ServiceCloud No: 00834973 Rally No: DE322150
Fixed a defect in DXconfig that was causing it not to populate the "prefix" property for DSA configurations that were migrated from DXmanager. This has resulted in the error message "DxagentException: Schema validation failed on property '1': 'prefix' is a required property" when such DSA was being modified via the Management UI.

Rally No: US365390
Upgraded third party library CAPKI to 5.2.4. All executable binaries now link with this CAPKI version.

Rally No: DE322276
Fixed a defect in DXconfig that left external monitoring in an active state after being removed. This was caused by the omission of "clear external-monitoring" statement in server configuration when external monitoring was completely removed. A re-init of the DSA would have no effect on the active external monitoring and only a restart would stop it.

Rally No: DE320425
Fixed a defect in DXagent where it was not reading the dxgrid-db-location of DSAs that were created by DXmanager. These DSAs have their configuration stored in an XML file.

Rally No: DE315916
'dsa-name' property is no longer hard-coded and is visible in the Management UI.

Rally No: DE277354
Host can be edited in Management UI after certificates have been regenerated. Certs are now retrieved from embedded DSA cache.

Rally No: DE317496
Fixed buffer overflow in DSA when it receives a request with attribute options that are not ";binary" and ";lang-en".

Rally No: DE308875
When changing an unmanaged DSA from "ca" to "dxlink" in the Management UI, the defaults for a "dxlink" DSA (and vice-versa) weren't updated.

ServiceCloud No: 00839026 Rally No: DE317112
The 'get user;' DXconsole command now displays the current value of cpu-starvation-threshold.

Rally No: DE313983
Removed the grey highlight on the DSAs that aren’t selected in Charts tab.

Rally No: DE313984
Added caret icon to counter dropdown on Chart tab.

ServiceCloud No: 00840118 Rally No: DE315652
The Management UI Server only loads the first certificate from the DSA trusted certificate bundle (trusted.pem). If the embedded DSA certificate's issuer is not first on the list then it will not be loaded. This can happen if the command "dxcertgen certs" is used to regenerate all DSA certificates because the root CA ("DXCertGenCA") is added in the last position. This is now fixed so that all certificates in the bundle are loaded.

ServiceCloud No: 00754930 Rally No: DE315039
Management UI no longer sends default value for dsa.config.ssl.cert-dir if the input is left blank.

ServiceCloud No: 00825287 Rally No: DE312236/DE313078
CA Directory now supports ciphers that use Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key exchange.

Rally No: DE309137
On Linux during the management UI upgrade from 12.5.01 to 12.6.03 the $DXUIHOME/CA folder is deleted. To fix this problem webserver certificates are now re-generated during installation if CA folder is missing.

ServiceCloud No: 00799111 Rally No: DE308880
From the management UI, the support and documentation links now point to the correct pages.

Rally No: DE304477
When selecting a managed DSA icon from the management UI topology or tree view, the CA Directory version of the DSA is now displayed.

Rally No: US373615
Upgraded third-party libraries json-c to version 0.12.1, libxml2 to 2.9.4, libxmlsec to 1.2.24, pcre to 8.41, zlib to 1.2.11.

Rally No: DE303608
DXserver pull replication will perform a range check on ODSEE when no changelogs are returned after configured number of retries. The changelog range determines if DXserver will need to adjust its pull replication window. This addresses the issue of ODSEE changelog clean-up leaving DXserver pull replication window out-of-range, and resulting in the pull replication not progressing to the next batch/window of changelogs.

Rally No: DE306578
Configuration items containing multiple DNs are now supported. Entering a comma in DN list inputs will no longer add a new item as DN's contain commas. DN items are now added using the Enter key.

Rally No: US344778
CA Directory can contain entries that are critical to the operation of CA Directory and applications. If these entries are accidently removed or renamed then this has the potential to cause unexpected outages. Access controls are the first line of defence to ensure these entries aren't updated, but there are circumstances where this protection isn't enough, for example, if a super-user is performing updates via a LDAP browser.

The new command 'set critical-entries = <DN list>;' can be set to prevent these entries and their parent entries from being renamed or removed.

For example,

set critical-entries = <c AU><ou users><cn admin>,
                       <c AU><ou groups>,
                       <c AU><ou users><cn admin : uid 1234>;   # multi-valued RDN example

A rename/remove of the following entries will be prevented with unwillingToPerform:
* <c AU>
* <c AU><ou users>
* <c AU><ou users><cn admin>
* <c AU><ou groups>
* <c AU><ou users><cn admin : uid 1234>

If "set role-subtree = <c AU><ou groups>;" is configured, then this will now be protected by critical-entries is renaming this entry may cause access controls to start failing.

Rally No: DE300927
Fixed a defect where the Management UI and DXserver Windows installers were not deleting the installation folder on uninstall.

Rally No: DE304222
Fixed an issue where DXagent returned DSA knowledge in reverse order. If the DSA config was modified in the Management UI this resulted in the knowledge being persisted in reverse order.

ServiceCloud No: 00741609 Rally No: DE304458
An issue has been resolved where a rename request specifying a new naming attribute was permitted even though the attribute did not exist in the object class list for that entry.

For example,
dn: ou=acme,c=au
objectClass: organizationalUnit

A rename request of ou=acme,c=au with a new RDN of cn=acme would be permitted, even though cn is not supported by the organizationalUnit object class.


This behavior has been corrected, however, there maybe use cases that rely on this non-standard behvior. If this is the case, the original functionality can be re-instated, 'set rename-check-oc = false;'

Rally No: DE300928
Fixed a defect in Management UI windows installer where the backup dialog prompt was hidden during uninstallation.

Rally No: DE303910
Fixed a defect in the Management UI installer for Linux where a hostname FQDN failure is not correctly detected to abort the installation. This resulted in the web server certificate to be an empty file.

ServiceCloud No: 00754930 Rally No: DE298852
Fixed a defect where the 'Edit DSA' modal would hang due to a syntax error in its config, preventing the UI from determining if the DSA is a data or router DSA.

Rally No: DE296274
Added management UI product version information in the about box.

ServiceCloud No: 00780276 Rally No: DE302449
Fixed an vulnerability issue in management UI. The solution is to intercept the error code "File not found" and return a generic error message so that no internal directory structure information can be revealed and no script injection can be done. 

ServiceCloud No: 00756389 Rally No: DE299080
Fixed an issue in SCIM 1.0 server that when connections became invalid (e.g. shut down from DSA end due to time out), those connections were not destroyed and still returned to the pool which caused later problems.

ServiceCloud No: 00778822 Rally No: DE302549
Fixed an issue in DXserver where access control roles are not propagated to subordinate/peer DSAs, which causes access control denial in the subordinate/peer DSAs.

Rally No: DE302125
A memory issue has been addressed when processing a DXlink response while the same DXlink connection is in the process of being closed. The following assertion failure is logged:
    * [6] 20170626.120632.761 /release/HEAD.new/dxgrid/src/dsa/rstack/support/xmpool.c(290): Assertion failed

Rally No: US340297
Added support for entryUUID (RFC4530). This feature can be enabled by specifying the following configuration:
    set add-entryuuid = true;
As entryUUID is an operational attribute, "op-attrs" must also be set to true (its default value is true) to enable entryUUID.
It is not enabled by default. When enabled, the DSA will generate new entryUUID when an entry is added. The DXloaddb utility generates entryUUID for every entry that does not have one specified in the source LDIF file.
 
ServiceCloud No: 00771362 Rally No: DE300157
Fixed an issue in DXserver where when in FIPS mode the Protocol configuration was ignored and always used TLS 1.0.

ServiceCloud No: 00753364 Rally No: DE295295
Fixed an assertion failure in dxadmind that led to a crash. This can only occur in a specific scenario where
sending of persistent search response encounters a short write and at the same time the socket is being
closed. The fix involves a partial merge of openldap fix for ITS#4667.

ServiceCloud No: 00743318 Rally No: DE292979
The force-encrypt-auth setting is now ignored for local DXconsole connections. Bind authentications in cleartext are always allowed if clients are connected to the local DXconsole port (console-port).

ServiceCloud No: 00685446 Rally No: DE289845 & DE278954
DXserver will no longer log benign replication errors when handling delete requests with the 'tree-delete' LDAP control where the target of the delete does not exist.

Rally No: DE293205
A potential DXserver memory leak has been addressed when LDAP clients abort connections while in the process of performing a large number of asynchronous requests.

Rally No: DE291770
Improved DXserver memory utilization when sending a lot of small requests/responses and the connection is blocked.

Rally No: DE290952
Fixed an issue in DXagent that occurs when some special characters are included in string type settings. Enabled relative path conversion for SSL path based settings.

Rally No: US324697
Added support in DXserver to allow outgoing SSL/TLS connections without certificate/key. No configuration is necessary to enable this. If no certificate can be found for a particular DSA, then outgoing SSL/TLS connections from that DSA will be attempted without certificate.

Rally No: DE277472 & DE281464
Fixed Management UI not giving user ability to edit embedded DSA if any dxagents were unreachable.

Rally No: DE283561 & DE256361
Fixed inconsistent escaping of horizontal partitioning configuration in DXagent. Relaxed partition count checking in DXtools & DXagent to allow partitions to be created in Management UI.

ServiceCloud No: 00714415 Rally No: DE288357
Fixed Management UI Windows installer failure when the selected target is on a volume that does not have short filename (8dot3) enabled. Typically this problem is observed when installing on other than drive C:.

Rally No: US320035
Added support for configuring External Monitoring in DXagent.
    
Rally No: DE279152
Fixed inconsistent error code in DXagent when retrieving an online backup in DB format from a DSA that does not have an online backup. Error code 404 is now returned for both DB and LDIF formats.

Rally No: DE262933

To assist with migration from Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition (ODSEE), CA Directory has received several enhancements.

Please consult the "Migrating from Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition to CA Directory" Guide in the product documentation for further details.

dxloaddb
  Now supports a continuous mode of operation. The option -e that ignores issues that prevent entries from loading and continuous processing the LDIF. This works in both normal and dry run modes.

dxmigrate
  A new tool is now shipped in the CA Directory packages to assist with migration of ODSEE password policy configuration and exported data. Please consult the documentation for further details.

Phased migration - To allow for a phased migration from ODSEE, CA Directory now supports two-way replication.

  CA Directory -> ODSEE (DXlink replication)
  * When replicating over DXlink, multi-write will always replicate using the configured LDAP DSA Name and LDAP DSA password user.
  * Replication now supports Multwrite Ignore Attrs to specify a list of attributes that should not be included when replicating add and modify requests.

  ODSEE -> CA Directory
  CA Directory now supports pull replication from ODSEE using the retro changelog feature. This can be configured via the following command or via the Settings tab in the Management UI:

  set pull-replication = {
      source = "dxlink"
      location = <cn changelog>
      interval   = 10
      window-size = 20
      retries     = 30
      ignore-attrs = aci, pwdFailureTime, pwdAccountLockedTime, pwdHistory, passwordHistory, modifiersName, modifyTimestamp
  };

  Where
    source: is the DSA name from the DXlink reference or unmanaged DSA (UI)
    location: is where the retro changelog entries are stored
    interval: Number of seconds between when replication is performed
    window-size: The window of updates retrieved per replication request
    retries: The number attempts where no entries were retrieved before logging an alert
    ignore-attrs: Attributes from ODSEE to ignore from add and modify requests

Rally No: F33742
The Management UI have been internationalized. Localized resources have been added for Japanese and French.

The ldif2dxc tool has been enhanced when presented with non-standard's compliant schema. When a structural object class definition is missing a super class, it is not longer treated as abstract. The object class will be kept as structural and a super class of "top" included in the definition.

Rally No: DE275936
An issue has been resolved in DXagent where when uploading a DSA DB file on Windows, the Local Service user was not assigned appropriate file permissions.

Rally No: TA528192
New "-e" option is added to dxloaddb tool, which allows dxloaddb to ignore errors in LDIF file and continues processing. This does not include errors in object relations, where an object cannot be found for a relative DN. These errors are fatal and cannot be ignored.

Rally No: DE272171
In Linux Management UI installer default option is changed to N for 'Do you want to use your own certificates to secure Management UI web server communications?' question. Also added certificate and private key validation:	check if provided file can be accessed, check if provided files actually contains a certificate and a private key, check if provided certificate matches the private key.

A Management UI issue has been resolved during DSA creation, where DB file uploading would result in an error.

Rally No: US261705
For synchronous multi-write replication, when updates are sent and enter the pending state the DSA now stores a timeout on each queued item. This timeout is cleared when an acknowlegement is received.
When queueing a new item the DSA will now check if the first item in the queue has timed out, if so an alarm is logged.

Rally No: DE274939
To improve compatibility with the Management UI/DXagent, the dxnewdsa tool no longer accepts multi-byte DSA names. DSA names are now restricted to the following range of characters [a-zA-Z0-9-_.].

ServiceCloud No: 00660525 Rally No: DE272674
A MW-DISP conflict resolution issue has been resolved where:
* dsa1 and dsa2 lose contact
* entryA is renamed to entryB on dsa1
* entryA is updated on dsa2 (with old name)

When contact is re-established
* MW-DISP recovery from dsa1 -> dsa2 will continually fail
* The entry will no longer by synchronized between dsa1 and dsa2 as the update
  will be applied using the old name

The DSA will now resolve this conflict by allowing the rename to be applied during MW-DISP recovery from dsa1 -> dsa2 and the DSA will attempt to apply the update from dsa1 to the renamed entry.

As part of this change, DE206334 has been backed out. While this produces consistent modifyTimestamps for renames, it had the side effect of impacting data integrity. When an entry is updated on one DSA and renamed on another while the link between them was down. During conflict resolution the more recent rename now wins over the update ensure the entries (apart from modifyTimestamp) are identical.

Rally No: DE271462
Fixed an issue that prevents weak hash algorithm usage in FIPS mode warning to be logged if the SSL configuration precedes password-storage setting in configuration file.

Rally No: US209892
When a search request exceeds max-op-time or exceeds non-zero value of time-log-search-threshold with time logging enabled. The search filter is examined for attributes that are not indexed. A warning is logged for each non-indexed attribute.
E.g. WARN : Attribute used in filter: mail is not indexed
These warnings assist in the diagnosis of abnormally slow requests and assist in the tuning of indexes.

Rally No: US261211
Stats log now includes two new items CPU Seconds and CPU kTicks. CPU Seconds is the number of seconds within the last minute that the DSA scheduler iterated at least once. CPU kTicks is the number of times the DSA scheduler iterated in the last minute, each unit is 1000 ticks.
A new setting has been introduced "cpu-starvation-threshold" this defaults to 5, to disable set to -1. If the CPU starvation threshold is exceeded an alarm is logged indicating that CPU starvation has been detected. 
For example if the DSA has the default threshold of 5 seconds and CPU Seconds falls below 55 seconds in the last minute an alarm is logged. Or if the stats log entry is overdue by more than 5 seconds e.g it was logged at 20170118.150411 instead of 20170118.150400 it is overdue by 11 seconds and has exceeded the threshold.
CPU starvation alarms may correlate with abnormally slow requests in a customers environment and provide an indication of root cause such as a VMware vMotion event.

Rally No: US271932 & US271933
Upgraded to CAPKI 5.2.0. An alarm message will now be logged if password-storage is set to a non FIPS compliant algorithm when the DSA
is configured to run in FIPS mode.

An issue has been addressed where modifyTimeStamp was not replicated in a multiwrite setup when password policies are enabled and a user is changing their own password.

ServiceCloud No: 00609632 Rally No: DE254551
This defect is a follow-up to DE224007. The previous fix requires a recovering DSA to receive an "empty modify" to switch out of
recovery mode. In a rolling upgrade scenario, DSA's of older versions/service packs do not send "empty modify" and the newly
upgraded DSA remains in recovery indefinitely. A timeout of 30 seconds in now implemented for a recovering DSA to wait for the
"empty modify".

For the following configuration, it is difficult to stop all the DSAs servicing a specific multi-write group (region) when under a reasonable modify load:
* vanilla multi-write replication (MW-DISP not enabled)
* multi-write groups specified in the knowledge
* set wait-for-multiwrite = true;

To assist with maintenance activities that require all the DSAs from a specific group to be stopped, the command "set isolate-multi-write-group = true;" has been introduced.

An example procedure for stopping all the DSAs in a group is:
* connect to DXconsole for each DSA that will be shut down and perform "set isolate-multi-write-group = true;", or temporarily enabled "set isolate-multi-write-group = true;" in the configuration and re-init the DSAs of a particular group individually
* once set, all connections to other groups and non-peer DSAs will be aborted, allowing replication within a group to complete while taking on no further updates from other groups/relays/routers
* when replication has completed the DSAs in the group may be stopped
* once stopped, if using the configuration based approach, the 'isolate-multi-write-group' command can be removed or set to false and DSAs can be started

Rally No: 202644
An issue has been addressed where the DSA can be left in an unresponsive state when a client disconnects that has a large number of pending requests.

ServiceCloud No: 00471191 Rally No: DE202354
An issue has been resolved where a client performing dynamic group (member=<DN>) searches disconnects while the search is in progress. This has the potential to cause the DSA to crash. This issues was initially resolved in 12.0.17 under the exclude member attribute change (CES: 80679 RTC No: 160194) and has now been strengthened.

As part of this fix, the following assertion failure has been downgraded to a warning as this is triggered by the above disconnect:
** FATAL ERROR **: Assertion failed (/release/HEAD.new/dxgrid/src/dsa/user/roles.c???)

The following assertion failure has also been fixed:
** FATAL ERROR **: Assertion failed (/release/HEAD.new/dxgrid/src/dsa/user/uDynamicGroup.c129?)

Addressed MW-DISP recovery performance issue where operational attributes, required by MW-DISP, are explicitly excluded from the cache indexes.

Rally No: DE186404
A long standing SSL assertion failure has been addressed. The assertion failure is harmless, but can raise concerns when encountered in the alarm log. The root cause of the assertion is when the number of concurrent SSL connections increases beyond 20. This is normally seen when performing SSL stress testing where a client creates a lot of new connections.

The dxsoak tool now includes a "-l <time limit>" option. The tool will run in continuous mode until <time limit> seconds have elapsed.

For example, to run the requests from searches.ldif for 60 seconds:
% dxsoak -l 60 -t 8 -q 100 -h host:port -f searches.ldif

Rally No: US170076
The new command "set dsp-link-count = <num>;" when set, will increase the number of outbound links from a router DSA to each subordinate DSA to <num>. By default, only a single outbound (DSP) link is created for each authentication level between DSAs. However, this can reduce router throughput in high volume environments, as the router DSA only has a single connection to send requests and receive responses from.

The "get dsas;" commandsetuid  will display virtual references to the same DSA that will be used to create the outbound links.

Note: Setting <num> larger than 10 may degrade performance, so 'dsp-link-count' should be tuned to your specific environment.

Rally No: TA372800
To bring DXcertgen in line with 3rd certificate authorities, the default key size of certificates generated using DXcertgen has been increased from 1024 bits to 2048 bits.

Rally No: TA368117
The SSL configuration has been enhanced to support a single personality certificate that can be shared among all DSAs. To configure a single certificate replace cert-dir with cert-file in the set ssl ... command. This will reduce the overhead when issuing DSA personality certificates from 3rd party certificate authorities where there are a large number of DSAs.

Note: This removes the restriction that the subjectDN must contain dsa-name.

set ssl = {
    # generic DSA personality certificate
    cert-file = "config/ssld/personalities/generic.pem"

    # trusted root CA that signed DSA certificates
    ca-file = "config/ssld/trusted.pem"
    protocol = tls
};

Rally No: TA368120
To complement TA368117, the dxcertgen tool has been enhanced to generate a generic personality certificate using the -g option. For example, the following command creates trusted.pem containing a root CA certificate and a generic DSA personality certificate under $DXHOME/config/ssld/personalities/{generic}.pem that can be configured against all DSAs using the set ssl command above.

% dxcertgen -g {generic} certs

The new command "set max-persistent-searches = <num>;" can be used to configure the maximum number of concurrent persistent searches. This was previously capped at 10, which is the default if max-persistent-searches is not set.

Note: Having a large number of active persistent searches may have a performance impact on directory updates.

Rally No: DE154880
The "get users;" DXconsole command that displays the list of active connections has been expanded to provide diagnostics for links created using the concurrent-bind-user account. This will assist with checking that the concurrent-bind-user feature is correctly configured.

Rally No: DE163192
The new command "set dn-substring-match = true;" enables support for substring (wildcard) filtered searches against attributes with distinguishedName syntax. This makes the directory index distinguishedName values using the LDAP string form.

For example, the following attribute:

member: cn=joeBloggs,ou=users,o=CA,c=AU

Will match following filters:
    (member=cn=joe*)
    (member=*AU)
    (member=*users*)

Note: The search filter does not support virtual attributes, for example, the member attribute populated by dynamic groups.

An issue has been resolved where executing the start-up script ("/etc/init.d/dxserver start" or "service dxserver start") when the DSAs are already running will leave the running DSAs in an invalid run state. The invalid state is where the DSAs are running without pid files under $DXHOME/pid preventing the "dxserver status" and "dxserver stop" commands from working. Note: we recommend starting DSAs using the dxserver binary (as the configured dsa user) rather than start-up script.

ServiceCloud No: 00263264  Rally No: DE138821
A multi-write replication issue has been resolved when replicating over an SSL encrypted link. If the link between DSAs hangs up while a master is sending to a slave, the multi-write queue for the slave can enter an invalid state causing the master to stop replicating. When this occurs, the warning "No MW response from DSA '{Slave DSA Name}' in last 60 seconds" is displayed every minute until the master of restarted.

Support roll-over of log files when the file number of lines exceeds the threshold configured.
The following commands have been added to turn on/off this feature for different types of logs:
set alarm-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set summary-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set trace-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set stats-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set query-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set update-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set alert-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set connect-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set warn-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set diag-log-max-lines=$NUMBER
set time-log-max-lines=$NUMBER

$NUMBER needs to be either at least 1000 or 0 which means the feature is off. 
When the feature is on and the configured threshold is reached, 1) for all types of logs except Trace and Alarm, new logs with _YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS format extension will be opened for future writing. e.g. router_summary_20150914_120413.log 2)for the Trace and Alarm log, the current Trace or Alarm log will be renamed to whatever the current log name with the _YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS format extension (e.g. router_alarm_20150914_110348.log), and a new log with the same name (e.g. router.alarm.log) will be opened for future writing. 
A new DXconsole command called "roll-logs;" has been added. It causes all logs configured with max-lines to rollover immediately. This will assist in creating a fresh set of logs when reproducing issues. Similarly a new dxserver commandline command has been added to do the same thing, e.g. "dxserver logroll democorp".
To assist with debugging the "get log;" DXconsole command displays a line count for each file currently open. Please refer to the document for an example.

An issue has been resolved where a router/relay DSA with roles enabled, may halt when concurrently chaining requests received from the same LDAP client.

ServiceCloud No: 00265426  Rally No: DE46448
Addressed two instances where response network packet corruption could occur. Both of these cases would cause the LDAP client to reject the response as invalid.

1. When the DSA sends a result that is blocked or partially sent, this is accompanied by the trace message "comms_send: combining buffer".
2. When handling multiple search requests from the same LDAP client. The search response may become corrupt when one of the search results contains more than approximately 200 entries (depending on size of information being returned).

StarTrak No: 21198548 CQ No: PROD00162880
Addressed an intermittent issue where deleting an entry immediately after modifying the same entry would fail when MW-DISP was enabled on the Windows platform.

This occurs because Windows default time resolution is 15.6 milliseconds making it possible that both actions have the same timestamps preventing a successful MW-DISP conflict resolution.
To mitigate against this a new Windows specific flag has been introduced:
    set windows-high-resolution-time = [ true | false ];
When enabled, this will change the system-wide default time resolution from 15.6 milliseconds to 1 millisecond.
This will provide better granularity in timestamps (logs/entries) and will reduce the chance of MW-DISP conflict resolution where the same entry is updated at  the same time.

StarTrak No: 21194026 CQ No: PROD00162631
Addressed an issue where a data DSA search with an SPR control would report 'Unavailable critical control' error when the search was outside the scope of that particular DSA.
Example:
    DSA1 � prefix = <o democorp>
    DSA2 � prefix = <o democorp><ou subtree1>
    DSA3 � prefix = <o democorp><ou subtree2>
Now, if a search request with a base-object of <o democorp><ou subtree2> and with the SPR control was sent to DSA1 then it returned an error with 'unavailable critical control' because DSA2 was outside the scope of the search. The search was then aborted instead of chained to DSA3.

Improvements have been made to how CA Directory handles the configuration problem that allows a user to bind and perform an update at an authentication level (min-auth) that isn't included in the knowledge 'auth-levels' of multi-write peer DSAs. This scenario would cause the DSA to produce an assertion failure and crash.
* The knowledge 'auth-levels' and link upgrading/downgrading are now validated to ensure consistency across CA Directory multi-write peers. An alarm will be produced if an inconsistency is detected.
* If an update is performed by a user at an authentication level that is not supported by the current DSAs knowledge 'auth-levels', then an alarm is produced and the update isn't replicated.
To avoid this situation the 'set min-auth/authentication' setting will be deprecated in future releases. This will be derived from the knowledge 'auth-levels'.
Note: DXmanager controlled DSAs aren't affected.

CA Directory has been enhanced to listen on all returned DNS addresses. This ensures correct fail-over even if some of the returned addresses are not valid.

CA Directory queries the DNS for a particular logical address (hostname). If more than one physical address is returned, all are retained.
In case the first address is not valid, the DSA will failover to the second, etc. Previously, only the first address would be accepted.

Note that the returned addresses are still screened according to preference. That is, if IPv4 is preferred, only IPv4 addresses will be accepted;
if IPv6 is preferred, only IPv6 addresses will be accepted; if no preference is stated, we will accept all the IPv6 addresses followed by all the IPv4 addresses.
Preference is expressed by using the prefixes tcp, ip, rfc1006, ipv6, ipv4. All except for ipv4 and ipv6 prefer IPv6 followed by IPv4.
Ipv6 specifies only IPv6 addresses and ipv4 specifies only IPv4 addresses.

StarTrak No: 20027429 CQ No: PROD00138195
A search containing the simple paged result LDAP control involving multiple DSAs will now continue even if some DSAs in the scope of the search cannot be contacted.

DirectoryString values received by DXgrid via LDAP updates now are given the
type UTF8string. Formerly they were given the type printableString, but this
resulted in interoperability problems. This is an X.500 issue and not an LDAP

If a new DSA with an empty datastore is updated using MWDISP by an existing peer
DSA then the new DSA will no longer send any data back to the existing peer as
part of the data synchronization.

Note: It is best practice to copy the data from the existing DSA to the new DSA
before bringing the new DSA online.

StarTrak No: 18416508  LabTrack No: 14409
The new command

  set cache-search-bias = <multiplier>;

where multiplier is a number between 1 and 1000, allows search processing to
favour the indexes.

Two properties of LDAP searches are the filter and the base object. The filter
can be mapped to an operation on an index [IND], while the base-object selects
subordinate objects [SUB], unless the base-object is really the root of entries
held by the DSA. When performing the search, DXgrid must choose which of [IND]
and [SUB] to use to find candidate entries. If [IND] is used, each candidate
entry will have to be checked against the base-object. In the case of compound
filters, parts of the filter may also have to be checked. If [SUB] is used, the
filter will have to be applied to each entry found. To choose between [IND] and
[SUB], DXgrid estimates the number of entries that would have to be processed
for each and chooses the method where the number of entries is least.

The above multiplier is applied to the count returned by [SUB]. This has the
effect of biasing the process towards [IND].

If using this command to tune search performance, be aware that it applies to
all searches, so any tuning will have to consider the full range of searches
expected.

Large DISP searches no longer block console access.

StarTrak No: 18416508  LabTrack No: 14407

LabTrack No: 13976
The command 'set multi-write-group-credit' will switch replication
from asynchronous (multi-write-group hubs) to synchronous (wait for

can be serviced (replicated).
This situation can occur if performing bulk front-end updates where
multi-write groups are configured on latent links.

The default grid size is set to 500MB instead of zero.

LabTrack No: 13820
We assume values of a particular attribute are regular expressions that may be
compared with values passed in by extensible-match filters. When an
extensible-match filter of the appropriate type is received, the value in the
filter is compared against the templates stored in the entries to achieve an
inverse match (value against filter, not filter against value).

DXdumpdb memory usage has been significantly reduced.

LabTrack No: 13644
Values of particular attributes may be compressed by setting

  set compress <type> = <attr>, ...;

<type> is one of base64, hex, deflate, deflate1, deflate2. deflate is fastest,
deflate1 balances speed with compression and deflate2 tries for maximum
compression.

Note: base64 should only be used when all values of the specified attributes are
base64 encoded. hex should only be used when all values of the specified
attributes are hex encoded. If the values of an attribute may encoded
differently then use deflate.

LabTrack No: 13609

On Unix and Linux you can now use a domain user instead of the default local
"dsa" user.
* You must configure the domain user before running the install
* The domain user must belong to the user group etrdir
* The home directory must be a writable directory in order for the install to
configure the profile that defines DXHOME

If the dsa user does not exist when installing, then a local user will be
created and a new install of CA Directory will take place as before.
Note - you can also customise the name of the dsa user. To do this define the
flag -dxuser <dsa-admin-username> on the commandline when launching dxsetup, or set
$DXUSER = <dsa-admin-username> in the reponsefile.

even if Directory was already installed in a different location.

StarTrak: 17260198  LabTrack: 13550
On Windows, Ingres is no longer stopped during the pre-upgrade verification.
If Ingres fails to stop during the upgrade, the user will need to stop Ingres
manually. This overcomes the issue were Ingres is still stopped after Directory
was migrated to DXgrid, and other applications still require Ingres.
